# Handwritten Digit Recognition System

## Overview

This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based system designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits. The model has been trained on the popular **MNIST dataset**, achieving an accuracy of 99%. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 99% accuracy on the MNIST test set.
- **Pre-trained Model**: The model is pre-trained and can be used out-of-the-box for digit recognition tasks.
- **Customizable**: The project allows for further training and fine-tuning using different datasets or custom images.
- **Educational Resource**: Perfect for learning and understanding CNNs and their application in image classification.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mihir1430/Hand_Written_Digit_Recognition-Deployment.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd handwritten-digit-recognition
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the model**:
    ```bash
    python recognize_digits.py
    ```


## Dataset

The model is trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of the following layers:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Max-pooling layers for down-sampling.
- Fully connected layers for classification.
- Softmax output layer to predict the digit class.
