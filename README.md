# Handwritten Digit Recognition Model

## Introduction
This project involves developing a handwritten digit recognition model using machine learning techniques and creating a user-friendly interface to interact with the model. The application allows users to draw digits on a canvas, which are then recognized and displayed by the model.

## Features

- **Handwritten Digit Recognition:** The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
- **Interactive Canvas:** A user-friendly canvas where users can draw digits.
- **Real-Time Recognition:** The model recognizes and displays the digit in real-time as it is drawn.
- **Beautiful User Interface:** An aesthetically pleasing interface designed for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow or PyTorch (specify which one you used)
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js, Angular.js, or Vue.js (specify which one you used)
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express.js (if applicable)
- **Database:** None required for this project, but mention if any database is used.
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS, Azure, or GCP (if deployed)

## How It Works

1. **Model Training:**
   - The handwritten digit recognition model is trained using a dataset such as MNIST.
   - The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from images of handwritten digits.

2. **Canvas Implementation:**
   - A canvas element is created in the frontend where users can draw digits using their mouse or touch input.
   - The drawn image is processed and sent to the backend for recognition.

3. **Recognition and Display:**
   - The backend receives the image, preprocesses it, and passes it through the trained model for recognition.
   - The recognized digit is then sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- A code editor or IDE of your choice.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and machine learning concepts.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Running the Model

1. **Train the Model (if not already trained):**
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```
    Note: This step assumes you have Python installed along with necessary libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

2. **Run the Backend Server (if applicable):**
    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```
    Note: This step assumes you have Node.js installed along with necessary dependencies.

3. **Open Your Browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port you specified) to access the application.

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to the application URL.
- Draw a digit on the canvas provided.
- The recognized digit will be displayed below or next to the canvas.
